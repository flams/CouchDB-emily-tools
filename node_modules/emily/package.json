I use requirejs: http://requirejs.org/\nDownload the latest version of Emily here: http://flams.github.com/emily/\n\n```html\n\t<script src=\"require.js\"></script>\n\t<script src=\"Emily.js\"></script>\n```\n\n```js\n\trequire([\"Module\"], function (Module) {\n\t\t// Do what you want with Module\n\t});\n```\n\n####In node:\n\n```\nnpm install requirejs\nnpm install emily\n```\n\n```js\n\tvar requirejs = require(\"requirejs\");\n\t\temily = require(\"emily\");\n\n\trequirejs([\"Module\"], function (Module) {\n\t\t// Do what you want with Module\n\t});\n```\n\n### Better integration within your application\n\nFor a better integration within your application, you can simply download Emily and copy the source files that you need into your application's file tree. Provided that you are using requirejs or similar, you'll be able to load Emily's modules just like any other part of your application and you'll also be able to use your preferred optimizer.\n\n### Going further\n\nCheck out Olives for scalable MV* applications in the browser. https://github.com/flams/olives\n\n\n",
